# 📱 SMS Spam Detector

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a **machine learning-based SMS Spam Detector** that classifies text messages as either **Spam** (unwanted messages) or **Ham** (legitimate messages). The model is trained using **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Naïve Bayes classifier**, achieving high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
✅ User-friendly **Streamlit** interface to check SMS messages.  
✅ **Preprocessing pipeline** to clean and tokenize text.  
✅ **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.  
✅ **Naïve Bayes Classifier** for spam detection.  
✅ **Real-time predictions** with high accuracy.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for Machine Learning & NLP)
- **Streamlit** (for Web-based UI)
- **Scikit-learn** (for Machine Learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for Data Processing)

## 📥 Steps to Run the Project
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
